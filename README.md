# TypeScriptAlg

Hey there, thanks for learning `TypeScript`. Here are some `TypeScript` algorithm so you can practise.

If I had to give you one piece of advice, is to code **functionaly** and not imperatively. `TypeScript` (and `JavaScript`) have so many useful functions you can use. The best place to find them is in the [MDN Web Docs ](https://linktodocumentation).

Before you start, don't forget to do the setup and most importantly, **don't cheat!** The aim of these challenges is so you can improve your coding skills and have fun.
## Setup

Before all, don't forget to run:

```bash
  yarn install
```
    
## Challenges

You'll see that there are many files in the root, but forget about those. You'll want to open the `challenges` folder. There you'll find all the challenges, each one in its own folder. 

Inside of each, there'll be two files:
- `index.ts`
- `test.spec.ts`

You'll only be interested in the `index.ts` file, there you'll find the challenge's instructions and it will be there that you'll code the function.

Check it out!



## Running the challenge's file 

You can run the challenge's file simply by running:

```bash
  npm run <the-name-of-the-function>
```
Note that the name of the function is (at least it should) be the same as it's folder.
## Testing

Once you have finished a challenge, you can test it simply by running:

```bash
  npm run test-<the-name-of-the-function>
```
